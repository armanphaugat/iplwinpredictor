The IPL Win Predictor is a data-driven application that estimates the chances of a team winning an Indian Premier League (IPL) match. It leverages machine learning techniques and historical match records to provide real-time predictions during a game
The IPL Win Predictor is a machine learning–based project that predicts the probability of a team winning an Indian Premier League (IPL) match in real time. By analyzing historical IPL data and live match conditions, it provides dynamic win percentages that enhance the excitement and understanding of the game.

🚀 Features

Predicts win probability of both teams during an IPL match.

Uses match parameters like:

Current Score

Overs Completed

Wickets Lost

Required Run Rate (RRR)

Current Run Rate (CRR)

Trained on historical IPL match data.

Real-time probability updates as the match progresses.

Easy-to-use interface for fans, analysts, and developers.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

Scikit-Learn (machine learning models)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualizations)

Streamlit / Flask (for interactive web app deployment)

📊 Workflow

Data Collection → IPL datasets from past seasons.

Data Preprocessing → Cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values.

Model Training → Logistic Regression / Random Forest for probability prediction.

Evaluation → Accuracy, ROC-AUC, and test results.

Deployment → Web app for real-time win prediction.
